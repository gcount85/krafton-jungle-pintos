An almost empty directory. 
You will implement virtual memory here in project 3.

- include/vm/vm.h, vm/vm.c

Provides a general interface for virtual memory. In the header file, you can see the defintion and explanation for different vm_type -- VM_UNINIT, VM_ANON, VM_FILE, VM_PAGE_CACHE -- that your virtual memory system has to support (ignore VM_PAGE_CACHE for now, this is for project 4). You will also implement your supplementary page table here (read below).

- include/vm/uninit.h, vm/uninit.c

Provides operations for uninitialized pages (vm_type = VM_UNINIT). Under the current design, all pages are initially set up as uninitialized pages, then it transforms to anonymous pages or file-backed pages.
